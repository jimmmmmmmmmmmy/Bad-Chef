Summary of Recipe Platform API Development
1. Backend Development
Endpoints and Models:
Refined endpoints for recipes, ratings, and favorites.
Ensured models (Recipe, Rating, Favorite) are well-defined with appropriate fields and relationships.
Authentication:
Secured endpoints using Depends(get_current_user) in FastAPI.
Updated logic to use current_user.id from the authenticated user instead of passing user_id in request bodies.
Testing:
Adjusted tests to work with authentication tokens.
Added tests for features like average rating calculation.
2. Frontend Development
Setup:
Built with Vite, React, and TypeScript.
Used Axios for API requests.
Authentication:
Created a combined signup/login page at the root path (/).
Protected the recipe list page (/recipes), redirecting unauthenticated users to login.
Routing:
Set up routes for login, recipe list, and recipe details.
State Management:
Stored authentication tokens in localStorage.
3. Deployment Considerations
CORS:
Configured CORS in FastAPI to allow frontend requests.
Database:
Currently using SQLite; recommended switching to PostgreSQL for production.
4. Next Steps
Granular Permissions:
Add ownership checks for recipe update and delete operations.
Frontend Enhancements:
Add a "Favorite" button on recipe details.
Consider using Context or Redux for more complex state management.
Deployment:
Suggested containerizing the app with Docker for easier deployment.
5. Troubleshooting
Testing Issues:
Fixed test failures by updating test helpers and payload structures.
Model Consistency:
Ensured input models (e.g., FavoriteCreate) exclude user_id since it’s derived from authentication.
6. Additional Features
Average Rating:
Added an endpoint (GET /recipes/{id}/average-rating) to calculate and return a recipe’s average rating.
User Profile:
Proposed a GET /users/me endpoint to display user-specific data.

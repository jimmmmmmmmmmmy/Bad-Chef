                        "When moisture starts to release from the mushrooms, season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking over medium-low heat and keep stirring the mushrooms so they release most of their moisture (about 10 minutes). Turn the heat off when the mushrooms just begin to dry and set them aside.",
                        "To make the béchamel sauce, start by preparing a roux. Add some butter to a small saucepan over medium-low heat. When the butter melts, add the flour and mix to combine. Cook for two minutes while stirring occasionally and then turn the heat off and set the saucepan aside to allow the roux to cool.",
                        "Now you need to make a flavoured milk for the béchamel. In another saucepan, add the whole milk, 2 small bay leaves, ½ onion with cloves, sea salt, black pepper and a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a gentle boil while stirring. The flavored milk is ready when the onion starts “dancing” or bobbing around.",
                        "Remove the milk from heat and let it rest/infuse for 5 minutes. Remove the onion, cloves and bay leaves after infusing.",

                        "Place the saucepan over medium heat and, while whisking constantly, bring the béchamel to a simmer. The sauce should start to thicken slightly when ready.",
                        "Place a fine-mesh strainer over a pot of cooked mushrooms and slowly pour in the béchamel. Use a rubber spatula to help scrape off any sauce stuck to the saucepan.",
                        "Mix to combine. Use a stick blender to further break down the mushrooms and help extract more flavor. Another round of straining and pressing the mushrooms through the wire mesh sieve adds more flavor and smoothness to the soup.",
                        "To finish the soup, add 3 ounces of milk and some whipping cream and mix well to combine. Gently heat to a simmer over medium heat. Adjust the seasoning to your taste.",

                        "To cook the chicken, add a mix of butter and oil to a casserole dish and brown the chicken pieces on a medium heat until golden, then transfer to a plate.",
                        "In the same casserole dish, cook the vegetables from the marinade for a few minutes before adding the chicken back to the dish. Add a dash of cognac and light it up to 'flambé'. Add the wine marinade and leave to reduce for 10 minutes.",

Fill with water half-way to the top of the onions and cover with a piece of parchment paper. Leave to simmer on low to medium heat until the water evaporates and the onions are caramelised (they should become light brown in colour). When done keep aside on a plate.",
                        "Fried Mushroom and Bacon: Add a tablespoon of butter into a frying pan on high heat and wait until the butters start foaming. Add the mushroom cut in quarters and fry until golden brown. Remove and keep on a plate. Next add the bacon cubes to the same pan and fry until lightly crispy. Then return the mushrooms to the pan, mix well before taking the pan off the heat.",
                        "Large croutons: Take a large white bread and cut the crust into triangles. Bring a frying pan to medium-high heat and add a nudge of butter, When the butter starts to foam add the triangles of bread and toast until golden brown on both sides. You may need to add more butter to the pan. When done set aside on a plate.",
                        "When the chicken is cooked after 30 minutes, take the meat out of the dish and set aside on a tray while you finish the sauce. Filter the sauce through a sieve and discard the garnish. Once the sauce has been filtered put it back into your pan.",

                        "Add the shallots, carrot and celery to the pot with a little butter (or oil if preferred) and sweat the vegetables on a low heat for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
                        "Pour in the cognac and deglaze and then reduce to a syrupy consistency. Add the white wine and reduce again for 3 minutes. Taste to ensure that the acidity has been reduced and if it still tastes too acidic, continue to reduce until this is achieved.",
                        "Put the chicken pieces back into the pot and add the stock which should fill the pot halfway up the chicken. Add the tied bunch of tarragon stalks and ensure they are submerged in the stock. Add some black pepper.",

                        "Whilst the chicken is simmering, heat the cream in a saucepan and add half of the tarragon leaves. Reduce the cream for about 5 minutes on a low heat, and then strain the cream to remove the tarragon.",
                        "Remove the chicken legs from the pot and set aside with the breasts on a tray covered with foil. Discard the tarragon stalks and increase the heat to high for 3-5 minutes to further reduce the stock.",
                        "Once reduced, add the strained cream and further reduce on a medium heat until a spoon coating consistency is reached. Stir occasionally to avoid burning at the bottom of the pot.",
                        "Chop the remaining tarragon leaves and stir into the stock keeping a small amount aside to garnish the dish. Reduce the heat to low and place the chicken pieces back into the pot and heat for 5 minutes with the sauce. Adjust the seasoning to your liking.",

                        "In the same pot, add a small piece of fresh butter and sauté the shallot for a minute or two. Pour in the cognac, and using a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan to release the caramelized juices. Add half of the mushrooms and bacon and cook for a few minutes to develop the flavors.",

Cover the pot with a lid and cook in the oven at 160°C / 320°F for 45 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. After 15-20 minutes of cooking, transfer the chicken breasts to a baking tray and cover with foil.",
                        "Once the chicken is cooked, take the pot out of the oven, and using a slotted spoon, discard the off-cuts and carcasses. Carefully scoop out the chicken pieces and place them on the tray with the breasts. Next, place the pot over high heat, stir in the cream, and bring the sauce to a boil. Let it reduce for about 5 minutes until it thickens to a spoon-coating consistency.",
                        "While the sauce is reducing, broil the chicken pieces in the oven on the top shelf for a few minutes, skin side up, until they become golden and crispy.",

After a minute, pour the wine into the pan to deglaze. Use a wooden spoon to detach the caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of the pan and let the liquid reduce until about 3 tablespoons of liquid remain.",

Once the stock is in, let it reduce for a few minutes until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. When ready, turn off the heat, add the butter, and incorporate it into the sauce by swirling the pan.",

Transfer the mayonnaise to a clean bowl, cover, and refrigerate for at least 10 minutes.",

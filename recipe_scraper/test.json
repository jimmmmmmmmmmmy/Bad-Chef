            "In a separate bowl, whisk together the crème fraîche and Dijon mustard. Pour in the warm, herby butter mixture, followed by the lemon juice and water. Blend until smooth and creamy. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed.",
            "Place back on the stove on very low heat to keep it warm and serve over grilled steak alongside fries and a side of green lettuce."
